# AI Prompting Tips for 3D Model Requests

## Introduction

Getting the best results from AI-powered 3D printing requests requires clear, detailed prompts. This guide will help you craft effective descriptions.

## The SPECS Framework

Use the **SPECS** framework for comprehensive requests:

- **S**hape: Describe the overall form
- **P**urpose: Explain what it's for
- **E**xact dimensions: Provide measurements
- **C**onstraints: List any limitations
- **S**pecifications: Material, color, finish

## Effective Prompt Structure

### Template
```
I need a [OBJECT] for [PURPOSE].

Dimensions:
- [Measurement 1]
- [Measurement 2]
- [Measurement 3]

Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

Preferences:
- Material: [PLA/ABS/PETG/etc.]
- Color: [Color choice]
- Finish: [Smooth/Textured/etc.]
```

### Example 1: Simple Object
```
I need a phone stand for my iPhone 14.

Dimensions:
- Height: 15cm
- Base width: 10cm
- Slot width: 1cm

Requirements:
- Adjustable viewing angle
- Cable management hole

Preferences:
- Material: PLA
- Color: Black
- Finish: Smooth
```

### Example 2: Complex Object
```
I need a modular desk organizer for my home office.

Dimensions:
- Overall: 25cm x 15cm x 8cm
- Pen holder section: 5cm diameter
- Document tray: 20cm x 10cm

Requirements:
- Separate compartments for pens, clips, and sticky notes
- Stackable design
- Non-slip bottom

Preferences:
- Material: PETG (more durable)
- Color: Navy blue
- Finish: Matte
```

## Key Elements to Include

### 1. Dimensions
Always specify:
- Length, width, height
- Thickness of walls
- Opening sizes
- Clearances

Use consistent units (metric or imperial).

### 2. Functional Requirements
Describe:
- How it will be used
- Weight it needs to support
- Environmental conditions
- Movement or adjustment needs

### 3. Mounting & Attachment
Specify:
- Screw holes and sizes
- Adhesive areas
- Clip mechanisms
- Connection points

### 4. Materials
Common options:
- **PLA**: Standard, eco-friendly, good for decorative items
- **ABS**: Strong, heat-resistant, better for functional parts
- **PETG**: Durable, flexible, good chemical resistance
- **TPU**: Flexible, rubber-like
- **Nylon**: Very strong, wear-resistant

### 5. Tolerances & Fit
Mention if:
- Parts need to snap together
- Screws need to thread in
- Items need to slide or fit precisely
- Clearance is critical

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Vague
"I need a holder for stuff"

### ✅ Specific
"I need a wall-mounted holder for 3 standard screwdrivers, with individual slots 2cm in diameter and 15cm deep"

---

### ❌ Missing Dimensions
"Make a box for my tools"

### ✅ With Dimensions
"Make a toolbox 30cm x 20cm x 15cm with a hinged lid and internal dividers"

---

### ❌ Unrealistic Expectations
"Create a full-size bicycle frame"

### ✅ Realistic Request
"Create a custom bicycle phone mount that attaches to the handlebars"

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Comparative Descriptions
> "Similar to a standard mason jar lid, but with a 5cm opening in the center"

### Reference Objects
> "About the size of a credit card, but 5mm thick"

### Functional Analogies
> "Works like a clip, but designed specifically for a 10mm thick panel"

### Iterative Refinement
Start broad, then add details:
1. "A plant pot"
2. "A small succulent pot"
3. "A hexagonal succulent pot, 8cm diameter, 7cm tall"
4. "A hexagonal succulent pot, 8cm diameter, 7cm tall, with drainage holes and a matching saucer"
