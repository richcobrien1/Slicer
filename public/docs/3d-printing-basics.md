# 3D Printing Basics

## What is 3D Printing?

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. Material is deposited layer by layer to build up the final object.

## How It Works

1. **Design**: Create or obtain a 3D model (CAD file)
2. **Slice**: Convert the model into printable layers
3. **Print**: Machine deposits material layer by layer
4. **Post-Process**: Clean, finish, and assemble if needed

## Common 3D Printing Technologies

### FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)
- Most common and affordable
- Uses plastic filament
- Good for prototypes and functional parts
- Layer lines visible

### SLA (Stereolithography)
- Uses liquid resin cured by UV light
- Higher detail and smoother finish
- More expensive
- Requires post-processing (washing, curing)

### SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)
- Uses powder materials (nylon, etc.)
- Very strong parts
- No support structures needed
- Industrial applications

## Materials Guide

### PLA (Polylactic Acid)
**Best for:**
- Decorative items
- Prototypes
- Learning projects

**Properties:**
- Easy to print
- Biodegradable
- Low odor
- Not heat resistant (warps at 60°C)

**Colors:** Wide variety available

---

### ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)
**Best for:**
- Functional parts
- Items that need heat resistance
- Durable objects

**Properties:**
- Strong and impact-resistant
- Heat resistant up to 100°C
- Requires heated bed
- Strong odor when printing

**Colors:** Many options

---

### PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)
**Best for:**
- Mechanical parts
- Outdoor use
- Food-safe applications*

**Properties:**
- Strong and flexible
- Chemical resistant
- Weather resistant
- Good layer adhesion

*Food safety requires specific certification

---

### TPU/TPE (Flexible Filaments)
**Best for:**
- Phone cases
- Gaskets and seals
- Wearables

**Properties:**
- Rubber-like flexibility
- Impact resistant
- Good grip
- Harder to print

## Design Considerations

### Wall Thickness
- Minimum: 1-2mm
- Standard: 2-3mm
- Strong parts: 3-5mm

### Overhangs
- Up to 45°: Usually OK without support
- 45-70°: May need support
- Over 70°: Definitely needs support

### Tolerances
- Standard: ±0.2-0.3mm
- Tight fit: Account for 0.1-0.2mm clearance
- Loose fit: Account for 0.3-0.5mm clearance

## Applications

### Prototyping
- Test designs quickly
- Iterate rapidly
- Low cost compared to traditional methods

### Manufacturing
- Custom jigs and fixtures
- Small batch production
- Replacement parts

### Art & Design
- Sculptures
- Jewelry
- Architectural models

### Education
- STEM learning
- Hands-on projects
- Visual aids

### Medical
- Prosthetics
- Surgical guides
- Anatomical models

### Hobby
- Miniatures
- Cosplay props
- Model building
- Custom tools

## Safety Tips

- ✅ Ensure good ventilation
- ✅ Don't leave prints unattended for long periods
- ✅ Keep away from flammable materials
- ✅ Handle hot parts with care
- ✅ Use eye protection when cleaning prints
- ❌ Don't breathe fumes directly
- ❌ Don't modify electrical components without expertise
- ❌ Don't print in enclosed spaces without ventilation
